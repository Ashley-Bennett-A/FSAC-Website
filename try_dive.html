            <h1>Considering a Try Dive?</h1>
            <p>The best way to see if you like the sensation of being underwater and want to learn to dive is to come
                along to a try dive session, it only costs £10.</p>
            <p> A Try-Dive can help you save time and money by
                finding out
                in advance if you like diving, giving you the chance to sample an exciting sport and to gain an insight
                into the fascinating world beneath the waves.</p>
            <p> Each try-dive lasts one hour and includes poolside
                tuition
                on diving techniques and equipment. A BSAC qualified instructor will take you for a scuba dive in the
                pool to make sure you get maximum enjoyment from your first scuba dive and are safe at all times. Once
                the session is completed you are welcome to join us at our clubhouse for a drink and a chat about
                diving. </p>
            <h3>How do I book a Try Dive?</h3>

            <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p>A towel and your swimming costume, everything else is provided. If you have a swimming top or shorty
                wetsuit you can bring it, otherwise a t-shirt would be advisable to both stop the equipment rubbing and
                keep you warm whilst out of the water.</p>

            <h3>Why do we love diving so much?</h3>
            <p>It is exciting –seeing marine animals, wrecks, reefs and seascapes.Relaxing – floating weightless
                underwater helps unwind from day to day stresses.Peaceful – the silent world, and floating among
                fish can make you feel calm and serene.Challenging – diving is an adventurous sport and there are
                skills that take perseverance to learn.Educational – in addition to ‘diving’ you inevitably learn
                about other things like weather, physics, biology, maritime history, seamanship, marine ecology –
                and it is all fascinating stuff.Really good fun – scuba is a social sport, organised as a group
                activity with everyone having a buddy for the dive. It is enjoyable to both plan and to do and also
                makes for great conversation afterwards.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you would like to progress your diving then the natural follow-up to your Try-Dive would be to join
                our club and begin training for BSAC's primary level scuba diver qualification - Ocean Diver. Further
                details of what this entails can be found in the Training section of the website</p>

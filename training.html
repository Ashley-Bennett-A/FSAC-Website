                        practical sessions in the pool. Once these have been mastered we move into diving in open water,
                        normally in a local quarry such as Vivian in Llanberis. After you have completed your training
                        and built up your experience of diving in different conditions and depths you will be able to
                        dive to a maximum depth of 20 metres.</td>

                        upon your open water diving skills and expanding your experience. When qualified as a Sports
                        Diver the depths to which you can dive can gradually be extended to a maximum depth of 35
                        metres. Sports Divers can dive with other Sports Divers.</td>
